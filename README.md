# 🚀 Cognifyz Full Stack Development Internship  
## Internship Project Repository (Tasks 1–5)

This repository contains the first **five completed tasks** of the Full Stack Development Internship.

Each task is structured as an independent mini-project to ensure:

- Clean separation of concerns  
- Independent execution  
- Professional project organization  
- Proper Git version control per task  

The work demonstrates practical implementation of:

- Frontend Development  
- Backend Development  
- Server-Side Rendering  
- REST APIs  
- Client-Side Routing  
- Validation Layers  
- CRUD Architecture
